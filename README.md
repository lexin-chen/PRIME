**ðŸª„ Mastering the art of protein refinement, one conformation at a time ðŸª„**

Refining protein structures is important because the accuracy of protein structures influence how our understanding of its function and its interactions with other molecules, which can help to design new drugs to target specific molecular interactions.  

This repo contains six different ways of determining the native structure of biomolecules from simulation or clustering data.

*Fig 1. Six techniques of protein refinement. Blue is top cluster.* 

### Usage
`modules` contains the functions required to run the algorithm. `scripts` contains many examples of how to run the protein refinery framework. The naming schemes followes the *Fig. 1*. `new_clusters` contains a sample clustering results from 

```
git clone https://github.com/lexin-chen/PRIME.git
```

"""
Keyes are frame #.
Values are [cluster 1 similarity, cluster #2 similarity, 
            ..., average similarity of all clusters]
"""
{f1: [0.1,
      0.2,
      ...
      average],
 f2: [0.2,
      0.3,
      ...
      average],
```
Step 3. Determine the native structure using `scripts/rep.py`.
